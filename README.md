1. Baroque.me

I like how they incorperated music into the javascript code.  It looks complex but also simple.

They made a great use of the mouse scrolling as a zoom feature.  It's the first website I've seen that used it.

3. http://lostworldsfairs.com/atlantis/

THis is a fun website to play around with as you explore the site itself.  I like websites that keep people's 
attention as they go through it.  This site is a good example of that.

4.http://www.cascadebreweryco.com.au/

This site is a favorite of mine because it makes learning fun.  Not only do you get to interact with the site
but you learn how to make beer while you go through the site.

5. http://tobiasahlin.com/

This site doesn't really have the eye popping dynamic features of the other sites but I like this one because 
of the artistic design and most of all the simple but effective layout.  It isn't too overpowering but it
gets the job done of giving a fun overview of the designer.

This website has a childish look to it but it still works in my opinion of producing a nice webpage.
It would have been fun if it were interactive but still had an interesting layout and design.

THis is a cool site where the images are nicely collected and displayed.  The feature on the right side has a nice
layout that doesn't crowd the page with images but instead displays them in a nice layout and has descriptions on 
the side with a nice javascript effect added on.

THis is another website just like number 3 where the image on the background changes as you scroll down.  It 
gives the page an ineresting dynamic interactivity.

I liked this example not because of the website design(which I don't like) but the onclick blur over the images.
It's in a defferent language but the "about us" "contact" and other buttons are linked to images that are 
scattered on the page and lead to exploring the rest of the page to find the other buttons.

As a fellow artist I liked how organized this developer was.  The use of javascript to display a portfolio was
a great idea.  It was a neat and tiddy display.  The whole page was a good thing to look at in general.
